# What is Fair?

How can we make sure that each winner receives a fair portion as compared to others based on the available weekly prizes especially when the total value of the prize is not evenly divisible by the number of winners?

In such a scenario, the fairness can only be achieved when the difference in price value between the winners is at minimum. Such that The difference in prize between winner A and B is small.

Let's look at a total prize value of 1000 that is to be shared fairly across 6 winners. For a fair distribution, each winner will receive a total of 150. Distribute the remaining prize value(100) by giving each winner an additional priza until the remainig prize value is exausted or all winners have received the same number of prizes or the remaining prize cannot be subdivided equally further.

# How?

* First we will read the prizes and winners from the input.
* Next we will work out the complete value of the prizes and the prize esteem per winner.
* Next we will utilize these values (prize value per winner) to make a map that will connect every winner with a rundown of prizes they have won.
* We then emphasize through the prizes and allocate them to the winners.  we do this in a round-robin fashion(A round robin is an arrangement of choosing all elements in a group equally in some rational order, usually from the top to the bottom of a list and then starting again at the top of the list and so on.) starting over from the first winner. After each winner has been asigned a prize, we start over again from the top to asign the remaining prize.
* Any excess awards will be assigned out to the winners such that will maximizes fairness.
* We at long last print the prize appropriation by iterating through the map, and printing out the winer and their rundown of prizes.
