Enclosed is programming problem. We ask that you read the description thoroughly, then create a program to it. 


Coding challenge
================

Please provide:
# your solution in Java, with no external libraries used except for test purposes (libraries such as JUnit are acceptable).
# a brief text description of your definition of 'fair' as applied in your code.


THE UNFAIR LOTTERY
==================

A lottery company shares out prizes to winning contestants every week. Most weeks, more than one contestant wins, in which case they try to share out the prizes as fairly as possible. Their prize distribution office has hired you to write a program that they will use to distribute prizes in the fairest way possible.

The program you write should take two lines of input:
- A comma-separated list of this week's prizes' values
- A comma-separated names of this week's winners

For example, the input could be:
100,800,200,500,400,1000
Joshua,Mahesh,Lilian

The program should then output the fairest possible distribution of prizes, by displaying one line for each winner, with the values of the prizes allocated to them. For example, given the input above, the output could be:
Joshua:100,400,500
Mahesh:1000
Lilian:800,200

The example above gives a perfect solution, where all winners get the same value of prizes (total value of 1000 each). In many cases, this will not be possible, but all prizes must be distributed and cannot be divided. Part of your job is to decide how you define 'fair' for these cases. For example, given the input

400,400,500,600
Barry,Sheila,Onyango,Wekesa

The following would be acceptable output, because there is no fairer distribution possible:
Barry:400
Sheila:400
Onyango:500
Wekesa:600
